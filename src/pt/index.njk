    <h2>{{ site.en.about_title }}</h2>
    <p>Our name is inspired by the crisp, crosshatched knurls formed through metalworking on a lathe and the
      organic, unpredictable beauty of wood grain in a natural knurl. One is engineered with precision; the
      other, shaped by nature. This balance between technical accuracy and aesthetic sensibility guides our
      practice, bridging the science and the art in mastering.</p>
    <p>From the coastal mountains of northern Portugal, we collaborate with artists both near and far, across
      genres and labels, from independent to major. Our studio setup combines analog precision with sonic
      flexibility, allowing us to create unique signal chains for each record and bring out the best in every
      album and song we work on.</p>
    <p>We've mastered countless records for vinyl and we're on Apple's list of certified partners for the Apple
      Digital Masters
      program. Whether your music is headed to turntables or the latest digital streaming platforms, we'll
      deliver the right masters for each and guide you through the entire process.</p>

          <p>Our mastering rates typically range from €50 to €80 per track (or $60 to $100 USD), depending
            on the length of the record and the engineer working on the record.</p>
          <p>All standard deliverables (high-resolution files, DDP for CD, vinyl pre-masters, etc.) are
            included in the price, we do not charge extra for different formats.</p>
          <p>Feel free to get in touch with your project details, and we'll be happy to send you a precise

        <div class="tab__content">
          <p>We typically deliver the first version of your mastered track or record within 2-3 business
            days after receiving all the necessary files.</p>
          <p>If revisions are needed, we usually turn those around in 1-2 business days, depending on the
            scope of the changes. We'll keep working closely with you until you're fully satisfied and
            the final masters are approved.</p>
          <p>If you're on a tight deadline, just let us know and we'll do our best to accommodate.</p>

        <div class="tab__content">
          <p>Absolutely! While most of our sessions are handled remotely (clients send us their files, and we deliver the masters for review) we're happy to have you attend the session in person, as long as it's booked in advance.</p>
          <p>Just let us know your preference when scheduling, and we'll make the necessary arrangements.
