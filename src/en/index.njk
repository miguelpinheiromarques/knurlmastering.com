    <h2>{{ site.en.about_title }}</h2>
    <p>Our name is inspired by the crisp, crosshatched knurls formed through metalworking on a lathe and the
      organic, unpredictable beauty of wood grain in a natural knurl. One is engineered with precision; the
      other, shaped by nature. This balance between technical accuracy and aesthetic sensibility guides our
      practice, bridging the science and the art in mastering.</p>
    <p>From the coastal mountains of northern Portugal, we collaborate with artists both near and far, across
      genres and labels, from independent to major. Our studio setup combines analog precision with sonic
      flexibility, allowing us to create unique signal chains for each record and bring out the best in every
      album and song we work on.</p>
    <p>We've mastered countless records for vinyl and we're on Apple's list of certified partners for the Apple
      Digital Masters
      program. Whether your music is headed to turntables or the latest digital streaming platforms, we'll
      deliver the right masters for each and guide you through the entire process.</p>
